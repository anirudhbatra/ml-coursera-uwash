# Machine Learning Specialization- University of Washington

Programming Assignments for machine learning specialization courses from University of Washington through Coursera.

Techniques used: Python, pandas, numpy,scikit-learn, graphlab

In terms of the library and packages, I only used graphlab and SFrame for Machine Learning Foundations. For all the other courses (Regression, Classification and Clustering) I have used pandas for feature enginering and scikit-learn to build out modeling.

Specialization Courses:
Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach

Regression: Predicting House Prices (Leverage Zillow data to build linear regression model to predict house prices)

Classification: Analyzing Sentiment (Build logistic classification model to analyze product sentiment)

Clustering and Similarity: Retrieving Documents (conduct cluster analysis for document retreival, tf-dif)

Recommending Products: Build Matrix Factorization Model and leverage Jaccard Similarity to Recommend Songs

Machine Learning: Regression

Project Overview: How to predict a house's price? How to evaluate model? How to prevent model from overfitting?

Simple Linear Regression: Implementing closed-form solution for simple linear regression

Multiple Linear Regression: Exploring multiple regression models for house prediction; Implementing gradient descent for multiple regression

Assessing Performance

Ridge regression

Lasso regression

Kernal regression

Machine Learning: Classification

Project 1 Overview: Build classification modeling to predict if an Amazon review is positive.

Project 2 Overview: Is this loan safe or risky?

In these assignments, I have built logistic regression modeling and decision tree modeling to predict if a loan is risky or safe and test classification errors for different models by both using scikit-learn and implementing the (greedy ascent, greedy descrsion tree and etc.) algorithm from sracth.
